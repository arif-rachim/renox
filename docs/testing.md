# Testing a Renox app

Tests are small programs that check your app for you. You run them with `cargo test`, and they
tell you at once if a change broke something, so you don't have to click through every page by
hand. This guide shows how to write them with `TestApp`.

### In this guide

- a first test: start the app, open a page, check the answer;
- sending requests and checking responses;
- changing the settings, and faking outside services;
- logging in and checking the session;
- checking the database, and filling it with fake rows;
- jobs, events, notifications, mail and commands;
- moving the clock forward;
- testing in a real browser.

### Words you'll meet

| Word | What it means |
|---|---|
| **test** | A function marked `#[renox::test]`. It passes if it runs to the end, and fails if something panics. |
| **assert** | A check. `assert_ok()` says "the page must have loaded fine"; if it didn't, the test fails with a message. |
| **request** and **response** | The browser asks for a page (a request); your app answers (a response). |
| **status** | A number in every response: 200 means OK, 303 a redirect, 404 not found, 422 invalid input. |
| **middleware** | Code that runs around every request: sessions, login, security checks. |
| **session** | What the app remembers about one visitor between requests, like who is logged in. |
| **CSRF token** | A secret code every form must send back, so other sites can't post forms as your users. |
| **migration** | A SQL file that creates or changes a table. |
| **fake** | A stand-in that records what your app does (like sending mail) instead of really doing it. |
| **htmx** | A small script that updates part of a page without a reload. Its requests get some different answers. |

### A first test

`TestApp` starts your whole app inside the test, with no real server and no browser. You then
talk to it the way a browser does.

Every request goes through the same router (the part that picks a handler for each address),
the same middleware, sessions and CSRF checks as in production. So a passing test means the real
app works the same way.

The database is a fresh one for each test: SQLite in memory, or PostgreSQL when
`TEST_DATABASE_URL` is set. The migrations run on it before the test starts.

```rust
use renox::prelude::*;
use renox::testing::TestApp;

/// The app under test: here just Renox's login pages (the `Auth` module), with its
/// account page (`.account()` adds `/account`).
fn app() -> App {
    App::new().module(Auth::new().account())
}

/// Guests are sent to the login page; a logged-in member sees their account.
#[renox::test]
async fn members_see_their_account() {
    // Start the app, with a fresh database.
    let app = TestApp::new(app()).await;
    // Make a user to log in with.
    let user = User::register(app.db(), "Ana", "ana@example.com", "password123").await.unwrap();
    // Not logged in yet: the account page must redirect to /login.
    app.get("/account").await.assert_redirect("/login");
    // Log in as Ana, then open the page again.
    app.acting_as(&user);
    app.get("/account").await.assert_ok().assert_see("ana@example.com");
}
```

What's going on:

- `#[renox::test]` marks the function as a test. Use it instead of `#[tokio::test]`.
- `TestApp::new(app())` boots the app.
- `app.get("/account")` opens a page, like typing the address in a browser. It returns the
  response, and the `assert_…` methods check it.
- `acting_as(&user)` logs the user in, without filling in the login form.

> **Coming from Laravel:** this is Laravel's feature tests: `$this->get(…)->assertOk()`

## Requests and responses

### Sending requests

- **Requests:** `get`, `post(uri, &[(field, value)])`, `put`, `patch`, `delete`, `post_json`,
  `post_multipart`, `post_body`. A `post` sends a form: a list of field names and values.
- **Request options:**
  - `app.htmx()` sends the request the way htmx does.
  - `app.request().header(…)` adds headers (extra details sent with a request).
  - `.json()` asks for JSON (it sends `Accept: application/json`). Then a guest gets a 401 and
    invalid input a 422, instead of redirects.
  - `.without_csrf()` sends without the CSRF token. (`TestApp` sends it for you otherwise.)
  - `app.csrf_token()` is the session's token, for a request you build yourself.

### Checking responses

- **Status:** `assert_ok`, `assert_status(n)`, `assert_redirect(to)`, `assert_hx_redirect(to)`,
  `assert_not_found`, `assert_forbidden`, `assert_unauthorized`.
- **Body** (the page or data that came back):
  - `assert_see` / `assert_dont_see` look for text in the HTML exactly as it was sent. Special
    characters are escaped there (`&` is `&amp;`), so write them that way.
  - `assert_invalid("field")`, `assert_header`.
  - `text()` returns the body as text, `json::<T>()` reads it as JSON, and `header(name)`
    returns a header (`Option<&str>`).
  - The fields `status`, `headers`, `body` and `view` are public too.
- **Invalid input:** `assert_invalid("field")` expects a 422 with an error on that field.
  - Only htmx and JSON requests get a 422, so send with `app.htmx()` or `app.request().json()`.
  - A plain form post is answered differently: with a 303 back to the form (the errors and the
    old input are flashed, which means kept in the session for the next page). So for that
    one, check `assert_status(303)`, then `get` the form and `assert_see` the message.
- **JSON:**
  - `assert_json_path("data.0.name", "Coffee")` checks the value at a path of keys and indexes
    (here: the key `data`, its first item, that item's `name`);
  - `json_path(path)` reads it;
  - `assert_json(json!({ … }))` checks the body contains the expected keys (other keys may
    be there too). Arrays are stricter: they must have the same number of items, in the same
    order (each item is then checked the same way, so an object in an array may have extra
    keys).
- **Views:** `assert_view("products/index.html")` checks the template a page was rendered from.

## Configuration and the app's parts

`TestApp::new` doesn't read your `.env` file, with one exception: `TEST_DATABASE_URL` (from the
environment or `.env`). It starts from `Config::default()`, which has:

- an in-memory database;
- `APP_ENV=testing` (so `SESSION_DRIVER=database` keeps sessions in memory, where the session
  helpers read them);
- the memory mailer (mail is kept in a list, not sent);
- no queue workers and no scheduler (so nothing runs in the background by surprise);
- debug on;
- a 30-second wait for a database connection (the `.env` default is 5: parallel tests open many
  SQLite files at once; an in-memory database still gives up after 2 seconds).

Every other setting has the default `.env.example` lists.

Change any of it with `TestApp::with_config(app, |c| …)`.

To reach the app's parts from a test:

- `app.state()` is the `AppState` that handlers get;
- `app.db()` is its database;
- `app.mailer()` is its mailer (`mailer().sent()` lists the mail).

The test below changes two settings, then fakes an outside web service:

```rust
use renox::prelude::*;
use renox::http::FakeResponse;
use renox::testing::TestApp;

/// Reads a setting of the test's own, and fakes an outside web service.
#[renox::test]
async fn rates_come_from_the_api() {
    // Start with a setting of our own, and with debug off.
    let app = TestApp::with_config(App::new(), |c| {
        c.vars.insert("RATES_KEY".into(), "test-key".into()); // what config.var reads
        c.debug = false; // production error pages
    })
    .await;
    assert_eq!(app.state().config.var("RATES_KEY").as_deref(), Some("test-key"));

    // From here on, web requests get fake answers instead of reaching the internet.
    let http = app.fake_http(); // `*` matches anything; "POST https://…" for one method
    http.on("https://api.example.com/*", FakeResponse::json(200, json!({ "idr": 16000.0 })));
    let res = app.state().http.get("https://api.example.com/rates").send().await.unwrap();
    assert_eq!(res.status(), 200);
    // Check which requests were sent, and how many.
    http.assert_sent(|r| r.method == "GET" && r.url.starts_with("https://api.example.com/rates"));
    http.assert_not_sent(|r| r.method == "POST");
    http.assert_sent_count(1); // http.sent() lists them: method, url, headers, body, json()
}
```

What's going on:

- `with_config` sets an app-specific value (`RATES_KEY`) and turns debug off, so errors show
  the production error pages.
- `fake_http()` stops real web requests. `http.on(pattern, answer)` says what to answer for
  addresses that match the pattern.
- `assert_sent`, `assert_not_sent` and `assert_sent_count` check what the app asked for.

Other fake answers: `FakeResponse::text(status, body)`, `FakeResponse::status(n)`,
`.header(…)`, and `FakeResponse::connection_error()` (as if the service were down). Give one
pattern several answers, and they're used in turn: the first request gets the first, and so on.

## Session and login

- `acting_as(&user)` logs in. `logout()` forgets the session, like a browser with its cookies
  cleared.
- `confirm_password()` passes `require_password_confirmed` (pages that ask for the password
  again before something risky).
- `assert_authenticated(Some(&user))` checks that this user is logged in,
  `assert_authenticated(None)` that someone is (any user), and `assert_guest()` that no one is.
- `assert_session_has("cart")`, `assert_session_missing("cart")` and
  `session_get::<T>("cart")` check and read values in the session.
- `session_cookie()` and `use_session_cookie(…)` let one test play a second device (say, a
  phone and a laptop logged in as the same user).

## The database

- `assert_database_has("orders", &[("status", &"paid")])` checks a matching row exists,
  `assert_database_missing(…)` that none does, and `assert_database_count("orders", 3)` how
  many rows a table has.
- `renox::db::capture_queries(future)` returns every SQL query the future ran, requests
  included. A test can use it to catch an N+1: a page that runs one more query for every row,
  so it gets slower the more rows there are:
  `let (res, queries) = capture_queries(app.get("/posts")).await; assert!(queries.len() <= 3);`

### Factories

Factories fill tables with made-up rows, so a test doesn't have to type every field:

- one row: `Product::factory().create_one(app.db()).await`;
- twenty rows: `Product::factory().count(20).create(app.db()).await`;
- with states (named changes, like `sold_out`) and sequences (a change that differs per row):
  `Product::factory().count(3).state(sold_out).sequence(|i, p| p.name = format!("Coffee {i}")).create(app.db()).await`;
- `make()` instead of `create(…)` builds unsaved models;
- for a single one: `factory().state(…).make_one()` / `.create_one(db)`.

## Jobs, events, notifications, mail, HTTP

Apps do work outside the request too: jobs (tasks put in a queue to run in the background),
events, mail, scheduled tasks and commands. In a test nothing runs in the background, so these
tools let you run the work, or record it and check it.

| Tool | What it does |
|---|---|
| `app.queued_jobs()` | The names of the queued jobs. |
| `app.run_jobs()` | Runs the jobs that are due. |
| `app.run_all_jobs()` | Also runs delayed jobs and retries still waiting for their backoff (the pause before a failed job is tried again), until no job is left. It stops after 1,000 rounds, so a job that queues itself again forever can't hang the test. |
| `app.fake_events()` | Records events instead of running their listeners. Check them with `assert_emitted::<OrderPlaced>(\|e\| e.id == 7)`, `emitted::<E>()` or `assert_not_emitted::<E>()`. |
| `app.fake_notifications()` | Records notifications instead of sending them. Check them with `assert_notified(&user, "order-shipped")`, `assert_notified_to("a@b.c", kind)`, `notifications()` or `assert_nothing_notified()`. |
| `app.fake_broadcasts()` | Records `state.broadcast` / `broadcast_to` instead of sending them to open pages. Check them with `assert_broadcast("order-updated", \|b\| b.data["id"] == 7)` or `broadcasts()` (each a `SentBroadcast`: `user_id`, `event`, `data`). |
| `app.sent_mail()`, `app.assert_mail_sent(to, subject)` | The mail sent so far (the test mailer keeps it). |
| `app.fake_http()` | Answers `state.http` requests with fakes and records them. A request without a fake is an error, so nothing reaches the network. |
| `app.kernel().run_scheduled("report")` | Runs a scheduled task now. |
| `app.kernel().call("products:import", ["a.csv"])` | Runs one of the app's own commands. |
| `renox::prompt::answering(["a.csv", "yes"], app.kernel().call("products:import", [""; 0])).await` | Runs a command that asks questions (`renox::prompt::ask`, `confirm`, …), answering them in order. |
| `my_app::app().run_args(["migrate:status"]).await` | Runs any command the binary has, built-ins included (`migrate`, `queue:failed`, `down`…), as `my-app migrate:status` would. Give the app a file database: each call boots it anew. |

> [!WARNING]
> `run_args` boots a new app on every call. With an in-memory database, each boot gets an
> empty one, so give the app a file database for these tests.

## Time

Some things depend on time: a session that ends after two hours, a password confirmation that
lasts three. Waiting for real in a test would be far too slow. Instead, `TestApp` can move its
clock forward. This is called **travel**.

- `app.travel(Duration::from_secs(3600))` moves the clock one hour forward for what the
  `TestApp` does next: requests, `run_jobs` and `run_all_jobs`.
- `app.at_travelled_time(fut)` runs other code at that time, such as a model call, a scheduled
  task (`app.kernel().run_scheduled(..)`) or a command.
- `app.travel_back()` returns to the present.
- Travel adds up: two hours, then one more, is three hours ahead.

What follows the travelled clock: `renox::db::now()`, sessions, signed URLs, the queue, the
cache, rate limits, the login lock and password confirmation. `TestApp`'s own session helpers do
too: past `SESSION_LIFETIME`, the next request starts a new session with its own CSRF token.

Say the app's billing page asks for the password again (and the app has the `Auth` module, which
gives the confirm-password page):

```rust
# use renox::prelude::*;
# async fn billing() -> &'static str { "Billing" }
# fn routes() -> Routes {
Routes::new()
    .get("/settings/billing", billing)
    .require_password_confirmed()
# }
```

A test can then check that the confirmation runs out:

```rust
# use renox::prelude::*;
# use std::time::Duration;
# async fn demo(app: renox::testing::TestApp, user: User) {
app.acting_as(&user).confirm_password();
app.get("/settings/billing").await.assert_ok();
// Jump four hours ahead: the confirmation has run out.
app.travel(Duration::from_secs(4 * 60 * 60)); // confirmation lasts three hours
app.get("/settings/billing").await.assert_redirect("/confirm-password");
# }
```

What's going on: the user logs in and confirms their password, so the billing page opens. Then
four hours pass. The page needs a fresh confirmation now, so the app sends them to the
confirm-password page.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Travel reaches only time read through Renox: `renox::db::now()` in app code, not
> `SystemTime::now()` or `chrono::Utc::now()`. Use travel rather than rewriting `created_at`
> with SQL or sleeping; examples/shop, jobs, api and hello show it.

## Browser tests

Most of an app is covered by `TestApp` requests. Some things only a real browser shows: a sheet
(a panel that slides in) opening, live validation as you type, a layout at phone width. For
those, serve the app on a real port and drive a browser over the Chrome DevTools Protocol (CDP:
the way programs remote-control Chrome).

```rust
# async fn demo(app: renox::testing::TestApp) {
let url = app.serve().await; // http://127.0.0.1:PORT, until the test ends
// Point a WebDriver or CDP client at `url` (fantoccini, chromiumoxide, or a Node script),
// e.g. open `{url}/products/new`, type, press Tab, and read `[data-error-for=price]`.
# let _ = url; }
```

`app.serve()` starts a real server on a free port and returns its address. The server keeps
running until the test ends.

Renox's own browser checks run headless Chrome (Chrome without a window) with
`--remote-debugging-port`, and a short script per page. The steps:

1. Log in through the form, then open the page.
2. Do what a person would: click, type, press keys with `Input.dispatchKeyEvent`. (Events made
   up by a script don't trigger every handler, so real key presses are safer.)
3. Read the DOM (the page as the browser built it), and take screenshots at 1100 px, 390 px (a
   phone) and in dark mode.
4. Check the console for errors and CSP violations (scripts or styles the page's security
   policy blocked).

> [!TIP]
> Look at the screenshots, not only the numbers. Layout problems (an element pushed off
> screen, a misaligned dialog) pass every assertion.
