# renox-editors

Rich text, Markdown and code editor fields, and a code entry for detail pages, for
[Renox](https://github.com/arif-rachim/renox) apps. They bring JavaScript the UI kit doesn't
carry (Trix, CodeJar and Prism, compiled into this crate, no build step), and a page loads it
only when it has one of them.

```rust
use renox::prelude::*;
use renox_editors::Editors;

App::new().module(Editors::new())
```

```html
{% from "renox-editors/editors.html" import rich_editor, markdown_editor, code_editor, code_entry %}
{{ rich_editor("body", "Body", value=post.body, required=true) }}
{{ markdown_editor("notes", "Notes", value=post.notes) }}
{{ code_editor("settings", "Settings", value=post.settings, language="json") }}
```

What it adds:

- three form fields that each send a plain field of their name, so `Valid<T>`, old input,
  errors, hints and live validation work as for the kit's own fields;
- `RichText`, the rich editor's HTML cleaned on the server as it is read (an allowlist of
  formatting tags; no scripts, event handlers, styles or `javascript:` links), and the
  `rich_text` filter that cleans stored HTML again when it is shown;
- the Markdown editor's preview, rendered on the server by the `markdown` filter;
- `code_entry`, code shown highlighted in an infolist, read-only, with a copy button.

The bundled libraries, their versions and licences are listed in
[assets/vendor/NOTICE](assets/vendor/NOTICE). The guide is
[docs/editors.md](https://github.com/arif-rachim/renox/blob/main/docs/editors.md);
examples/bikeshop uses it (its /about/fields form and the admin panel). Versioned with `renox`: use the same version for both.
