//! No N+1 anywhere (#243): the main pages, walked as a guest, a customer and
//! the owner, cost the same number of queries on the small seed (`db:seed`)
//! as on the large one (`demo:seed --size large`: Pagila's volume, ~15,000
//! rentals, 5,000 orders, 3,000 work orders).
//!
//! A page that loads a relation row by row would run a query per row it
//! shows, so with 25 rows on a page instead of a handful its count would
//! jump; one that loads relations with `belongs_to` / `has_many` / `Pivot`
//! (one query per relation, whatever the page size) stays put. The test
//! allows a few queries of difference (a section that is empty on the small
//! shop and skips its query) and a ceiling per page.
//!
//! The large seed takes ~10 s in a debug build on SQLite, so this runs with
//! the rest of `cargo test -p bikeshop` (and `cargo test --workspace` in CI).
//! On PostgreSQL (`TEST_DATABASE_URL`) it seeds the large shop too; CI's
//! PostgreSQL job runs it.
