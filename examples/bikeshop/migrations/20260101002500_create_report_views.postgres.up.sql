-- Dashboards, reports and exports (#242): read-only views the reports area reads. Nothing is
-- copied: each view is a query over the tables the other areas write, so the numbers can
-- never drift from the records. The same SQL runs on SQLite and PostgreSQL (the
-- `.postgres.up.sql` file is identical); sums are cast to BIGINT because PostgreSQL's SUM of a
-- BIGINT is a NUMERIC.
--
-- report_revenue: one row per line of income, whatever the stream, with BOTH store attributes:
--   owner_store_id     whose books it is in (the bike's or the goods' owner store),
--   operating_store_id the store that did the work (served the customer).
-- Revenue is counted when it is earned: an order once paid (not refunded or cancelled), a
-- rental once returned (price + late fee + damage fee), a work order once completed. Fleet
-- repairs (a rental bike in the workshop) are not income from customers: they are booked
-- between the stores (intercompany_entries), so they are left out. Plan visits (work orders
-- of a plan subscription) and plan payments (payable_type 'plan_subscriptions') are the
-- "plans" stream. `id` is unique across the four parts (source id × 4 + part).
