//! Where the shop's errors go (`App::report` in `src/lib.rs`).
//!
//! Renox hands every error a person should look at to the app's reporters:
//! a request that answered 500, a job that failed for good, a scheduled
//! task that failed. Renox logs them anyway; this reporter also keeps each
//! one as a line of JSON in `storage/logs/errors.log` (the whole report:
//! where, the message, the error chain, the request's method, path, id and
//! user), so in development the errors of the last session are in one
//! file you can open, and the request id leads to the log lines and to
//! `/_renox/debug`.
//!
//! In production a shop would send them to an error tracker instead
//! (Sentry, a chat channel): `examples/jobs` posts them to a webhook with
//! `state.http`.
