//! The plans' scheduled task, registered from the module's `register`:
//! `plans:visits`, daily at 06:00 (`APP_TIMEZONE`), before the shops open.
//!
//! 1. Plans cancelled at their period's end whose last day has passed end
//!    ([`visits::end_finished`]).
//! 2. Visits whose day passed without the bike are recorded as missed
//!    ([`visits::mark_missed`]): not rolled over.
//! 3. Every running plan gets its visits for the next week
//!    ([`visits::plan_ahead`]): a plan change whose day has come applies
//!    first; paused plans, plans on hold and pending ones make none.
//!
//! The reminder the day before is the workshop's own `workshop:reminders`
//! (18:00): a plan's visit is a booked work order like any other.
//!
//! The task is idempotent: run twice, it makes nothing twice (each visit
//! has its number, unique per plan). Several servers sharing a database
//! run it once (Renox claims each run, docs/scheduling.md).
