//! A plan's visits: made ahead as work orders, within the workshop's
//! capacity, and what the customer and the calendar do to them.
//!
//! **Making them ([`plan_ahead`]).** Every morning the scheduled task
//! `plans:visits` ([`super::tasks`]) looks [`AHEAD_DAYS`] days ahead for each
//! running subscription. Visit number `n` is due `n` periods after the
//! plan's first day, on the preferred weekday ([`visit_day`]): every week,
//! fortnight, month or quarter. Each due visit becomes a work order at the
//! home store, source `plan`, with the plan's tasks at no charge (the plan
//! pays for them), booked through the workshop's own
//! [`capacity::book`] (the same transaction and capacity check as an online
//! booking). A full or closed day moves it to the next day with room.
//! A visit is made once: `plan_visits` is unique per subscription and
//! number, and the subscription remembers the next number (`visit_seq`).
//!
//! **What makes none.** A paused plan, a plan on hold after a failed
//! payment, a plan waiting for its first payment, and a cancelled one. Due
//! days that pass while paused are counted and skipped, not made up later.
//!
//! **Afterwards.** The customer may skip a visit, or move it to another day
//! with room ([`capacity::move_booking`], the same rule as rescheduling a
//! booking). A visit whose day passed with the bike never brought in is
//! recorded as **missed** ([`mark_missed`]) and not rolled over. A failed
//! payment takes the upcoming visits off the workshop's days ([`hold`]);
//! the payment coming in books them again ([`release`]). A collected work
//! order makes the visit **done** ([`done`]).
