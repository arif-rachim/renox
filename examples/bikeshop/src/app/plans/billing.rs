//! What the shop sells through renox-billing (docs/billing.md): one
//! renox-billing `Plan` per service plan and way of paying, and the
//! gateways.
//!
//! **Plans in code, plans in the table.** renox-billing declares plans in
//! code (`Plan::new(key, label).price(…)`), because a Stripe Price or a
//! Xendit recurring plan can't change under a subscriber. The shop's
//! `service_plans` rows (what the admin panel edits: the description, the
//! parts discount, whether it is sold) come from the same list,
//! `seed::content::SERVICE_PLANS`, so the two always agree on the keys and
//! prices (`tests/plans.rs` checks it).
//!
//! **Keys.** A plan paid by card is the service plan's slug
//! (`monthly-tune-up`): Stripe when `STRIPE_SECRET` is set, else the
//! [demo gateway](super::demo) (local only). The same plan paid through
//! Xendit, by card or e-wallet, is `monthly-tune-up-xendit`
//! (`.via("xendit")`), offered when `XENDIT_SECRET_KEY` is set.
//!
//! **Currencies.** The shop's prices are US dollars (`APP_CURRENCY=USD`,
//! amounts in cents), and the card plans are charged in [`CURRENCY`].
//! Xendit only charges rupiah, so the Xendit copies carry their own price
//! in [`XENDIT_CURRENCY`]: the dollar price at the shop's fixed rate
//! [`RUPIAH_PER_DOLLAR`], rounded to a thousand rupiah ([`xendit_price`]).
//! The subscribe form says so next to the Xendit choice, and the
//! customer's invoices are shown in the currency they were paid in.
//!
//! **Prices.** A service plan's price is per visit; every plan is charged
//! monthly ([`monthly_price`]): a weekly check at $8.00 a visit is $35.00
//! a month (Rp 560,000 through Xendit). Plan changes take effect from the
//! next period (`without_proration`), and after subscribing, changing or
//! cancelling the customer comes back to their plans (`redirect_to`).
