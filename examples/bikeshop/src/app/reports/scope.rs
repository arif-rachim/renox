//! Whose numbers a report shows: which stores ([`Reach`]) and counted by
//! which store attribute ([`By`]).
//!
//! **Which stores.** The stores where the person holds `reports.view`
//! *now* (`AuthUser::scopes_with::<Store>`, #244): every store for the
//! owner's global role, the stores of their dated roles for a manager.
//! `?store=` narrows the page to one of them; anything else in it is
//! ignored (so another store's id shows the person's own stores, never
//! the other store's numbers).
//!
//! **Counted how.** A North bike rented out at South is North's asset and
//! South's work (#245). [`By::Books`] counts income in the books of the
//! store that owns the bike or the goods (`owner_store_id`); [`By::Work`]
//! counts it at the store that did the work (`operating_store_id`). Over
//! every store, both add up to the same company total.
