const GRID: Feature = Feature {
    api: "renox::grid",
    why: "A whole reporting table from one definition: the server pages, sorts and filters \
          (a filter in each heading that fits the column, dates in `APP_TIMEZONE`), and the \
          state lives in the address, so a filtered report is a link to send.",

const SEARCH: Feature = Feature {
    api: "Grid::searchable",
    why: "The search box looks in the text columns marked `.searchable()`: every word typed must \
          appear in one of them.",

const ADVANCED: Feature = Feature {
    api: "Grid::advanced_filter",
    why: "Questions the heading filters can't ask (\"over $1,000 **or** cancelled\"): rules \
          per column, matching all or any. Only the grid's own columns count, so nobody can \
          filter on a column the page doesn't show.",
};
const GROUPS: Feature = Feature {
    api: "Column::summary + Grid::groups",
    why: "Sums and averages under the money columns cover every row the filters match, not \
          just the page; grouping by store, status or category adds a subtotal per group. \
          Both work on the model's own columns, which is why the store's *name* is a column of \
          the view.",
};
const REMEMBER: Feature = Feature {
    api: "Grid::remember",
    why: "A manager who leaves the report and comes back finds it as they left it (filters, \
          search, sort, grouping, page size, kept in the session); column choices (order, \
          width, frozen columns) are kept per person in `grid_preferences`.",

const CARDS: Feature = Feature {
    api: "Grid::cards_on_mobile",
    why: "On a phone each row becomes a card with the columns marked `.mobile()`; the first \

          and dates, frozen headings) or a print page of every row the filters match, sorted as \
          on screen: the handler answers `grid.export(…)` before drawing the page.",

const VIEW_MODEL: Feature = Feature {
    api: "Database view as a model",
    why: "The grid reads a database view (`migrations/20260102001000_create_report_views.*`) \
          that joins the record with its stores', customer's and product's names. A view is a \
          saved query, so nothing is copied and nothing can drift; a read-only `#[derive(Model)]` \
          over it gives the grid plain columns to filter, group and sum.",
