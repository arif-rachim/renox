//! Dashboards, reports and exports (#242).
//!
//! | Who | Pages | File |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | The owner, managers (`reports.view`) | `/staff/reports`: the dashboard (income by stream, the fleet, the workshop, plans, the books between stores, help, trends, the best sellers, the stores side by side) | [`dashboard`], [`numbers`] |
//! | The same | `/staff/reports/{orders,rentals,work-orders,payments,customers,intercompany}`: grids to filter, group, sum and export | [`grids`] |
//! | The same | `/staff/reports/monthly`: the monthly report, run for any month, with progress | [`monthly`] |
//! | Everyone with `reports.view` in the active store | `/staff` (the staff home page) shows the store's last 7 days | [`dashboard::overview`] |
//!
//! Where the numbers come from: the `report_*` views ([`model`]), plain
//! queries over what the sales, rentals, workshop, plans and multi-store
//! areas wrote. Who sees which stores: [`scope`] (`scopes_with` over
//! `reports.view`, #244), and whose books or whose work ([`scope::By`],
//! #245).
//!
//! The area listens to the events that change income (a rental closed, a
//! work order collected, a payment received) and marks the cached
//! dashboards stale ([`numbers::changed`]).
//!
//! Made with `rnx make:module reports`, then the files by hand.
