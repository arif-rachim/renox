//! The workshop: customers' bikes, service tasks and work orders.
//!
//! A [`WorkOrder`] is done by one store's workshop (`store_id`) on a
//! customer's bike or on a bike of the rental fleet. A fleet repair of a
//! bike owned by another store is billed to that owner store
//! (`billed_store_id`), which the intercompany books record (#245).
//!
//! Migration: `migrations/20260101000800_create_workshop_tables.*`.
