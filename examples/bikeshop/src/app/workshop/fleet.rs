//! Repairs of the rental fleet: when the rentals area reports a bike that
//! needs the workshop (damaged at a return, or due for its service by
//! ridden hours, `rentals::FleetRepairNeeded`), a work order is opened at
//! the workshop of the store where the bike stands, labelled "fleet" on
//! the board. When the bike belongs to another store, the work order is
//! **billed to its owner store** (`billed_store_id`): the intercompany
//! books (#245) charge the owner for the repair.
