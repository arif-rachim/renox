//! ABAC: each action is checked against the store attribute that matters.
//!
//! Records carry up to three store attributes ([`StoreAttr`]):
//!
//! | Attribute | Means | Checked for |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | **owner** | whose books the bike or goods are in | prices, retiring or selling a bike, recalling consigned goods, the asset's history |
//! | **location** | where the bike or goods are now | renting out, the counter, stock takes, repairs at the bench |
//! | **operating** | the store that served the customer | the rental or order itself: returns, refunds, fees earned |
//!
//! A record implements [`StoreRecord`] to say which stores it has. Then:
//!
//! - [`can_in`]: does the user hold `permission` in this store (a role there
//!   within its dates, or a global role)?
//! - [`require`]: for one record and one action. Someone who may not *see*
//!   the record in any of its stores gets a **404** (another store's record
//!   doesn't exist for them, so ids can't be probed); someone who sees it
//!   but may not do this action in the store that matters gets a **403**.
//! - [`visible`]: the list query "records I may see in any of their
//!   stores" (`owner_store_id IN (…) OR location_store_id IN (…)`), from
//!   `permissions::scopes_with` + `Scopes::apply` (#244). A global role
//!   sees everything.
//!
//! None of these check a role's name; the owner passes because their
//! global role grants every permission.
//!
