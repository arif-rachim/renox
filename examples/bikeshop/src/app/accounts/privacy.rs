//! Privacy: a customer downloads their data, and leaves.
//!
//! **Download my data.** The privacy section's button posts to
//! [`request_export`], which only queues [`ExportMyData`] and says "we'll
//! mail you a link": gathering years of orders and rentals is work for a
//! queue worker, not for the request. The job writes one JSON file to the
//! storage disk (`exports/…`, a random name), then mails a temporary link
//! to it (`Storage::temporary_url`: signed, works for seven days), in the
//! customer's language. A daily task deletes exports older than that.
//!
//! **Delete my account.** Renox's account page deletes the login after
//! the password is typed again, then announces `AccountDeleted`. The
//! listener here ([`on_account_deleted`]) makes the customer anonymous
//! ([`erase`]):
//!
//! - removed: name (→ "Deleted customer #id"), email, phone, home address,
//!   ID number and its check, the ID document's files
//!   (`customers/{id}/` on the storage disk), notes on work orders;
//! - kept, pointing at the anonymous record: orders, payments, rentals and
//!   work orders, which the books need (totals, dates, stores);
//! - cancelled: service plans still running.
//!
//! The record itself stays, soft deleted, so every order still has a
//! customer. Renox already removed what hangs off the login (sessions,
//! tokens, notifications) and the audit log keeps "account deleted" with
//! the user's id only.
