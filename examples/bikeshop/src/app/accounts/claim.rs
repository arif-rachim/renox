//! A walk-in customer claims their record.
//!
//! The cashier knows Ana: she bought a bike at the counter last year and
//! rents one now and then, but she has never signed up, so her `customers`
//! row has no login. From her record, staff send her an invitation
//! ([`create`], [`send`]): a mail with a **signed link** (`renox::signed`,
//! valid for seven days) to `/claim/{customer}/{email}`. The signature
//! covers the customer's id and the address it was sent to, so the link
//! can't be changed to claim someone else's record.
//!
//! Opening it ([`show`]) asks her to log in or sign up first (the route
//! needs a login; Renox brings her back here afterwards), with the address
//! the invitation went to. Then one button ([`claim`]) links the record to
//! her login, in a transaction:
//!
//! - anything her new account already had (an order placed before she
//!   claimed) moves to the walk-in record, and the empty row made at
//!   sign-up goes;
//! - the walk-in row gets her login and address.
//!
//! **Once only:** a record that already has a login can't be claimed again
//! (the second click, or a forwarded mail, finds it taken).
