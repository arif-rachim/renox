//! Signing up makes a customer.
//!
//! Renox's `Auth` module owns `/register` (and `renox-oauth` makes accounts
//! for a first social login); [`on_registered`] is its
//! `Auth::on_registered` hook, given in `src/lib.rs`. It runs after the
//! user is saved and before they are logged in, for both ways in, and adds
//! the `customers` row that orders, rentals and bikes point at. If it fails,
//! Renox deletes the new user again, so no half-made account is left.
//!
//! It never links an existing walk-in record by email: the address isn't
//! verified yet when the hook runs, and anyone could type someone else's.
//! A walk-in claims their record through an invitation instead
//! ([`super::claim`]).
