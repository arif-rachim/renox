const ABAC: Feature = Feature {
    api: "access policy helpers",
    why: "Goods have an **owner** store (whose books) and a **location** store (where they \
          are). `access::find` gives a 404 to anyone who may see the record in neither (so ids \
          of another store's goods can't be probed), and \
          `access::require(user, permission, StoreAttr::…, &record)` checks each action in the \
          store that matters (`has_permission_in` from #244): selling and counting where the \
          goods are, writing off and recalling where they are owned. A role check alone \
          couldn't say which of the two stores the person works for.",

const SCOPES: Feature = Feature {
    api: "scopes_with",
    why: "Lists start from `access::visible::<M>(permission)`: Renox's `scopes_with` turns the \
          person's roles into the stores they may see that in, and `Scopes::apply` makes the \
          query \"owner store in (…) **or** location store in (…)\", so goods of North held at \
          South show up for both stores and for no one else. A global role (the owner) sees \
          everything, without any check on a role's name.",

const LEDGER_PATTERN: Feature = Feature {
    api: "StockMovement::record",
    why: "**Levels only change with a movement, in the same transaction.** \
          `StockMovement::record` writes the ledger row and upserts the level together; \
          `ledger::take` takes goods out only if they are there (`UPDATE … WHERE on_hand - \
          reserved >= ?`), so two people taking the last unit can't both succeed. \
          `ledger::mismatches` proves every level equals the sum of its movements (the tests \
          run it after concurrent sales).",

const AUDITED: Feature = Feature {

    why: "Renox's `Audit` module keeps `audit_logs`; `multistore::audit::record` adds the store \
          the person was working in and the roles they held **there** (from `assignments`, \
