//! Consignment between stores: goods sent from the store that owns them
//! to another store that sells them, and called back (#240, #245).
//!
//! The owner's decision: goods sent between stores are **always
//! consigned, never transferred**. A shipment changes the goods'
//! **location**; their **owner** stays the store that sent them, until a
//! customer buys them (then the seller owes the owner, minus its fee:
//! `multistore::books::consigned_sale`).
//!
//! | Step | Who (permission, in which store) | Ledger |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | request | the location store (`consignment.manage` there); the owner's own shipment starts approved | – |
//! | approve / refuse | the **owner** store (`consignment.manage`) | – |
//! | ship | the **owner** store (`consignment.manage`) | `consign_out` −q at (owner, owner), guarded |
//! | receive (also partly) | the **location** store (`stock.receive`) | `consign_in` +r at (owner, location) |
//! | ask back (recall) | the **owner** store (`consignment.manage`) | – |
//! | send back | the **location** store (`consignment.manage`) | `recall` −q at (owner, location), guarded |
//! | receive back | the **owner** store (`stock.receive`) | `recall` +q at (owner, owner) |
//!
//! Between "ship" and "receive" the goods are **in transit**: out of the
//! owner's shelf, not yet on the other's; the shipment's lines say how
//! many (`quantity − received_quantity`). Anything never received is the
//! owner's loss (it was still theirs), and they are told.
//!
//! Every step checks the shipment's status in its `UPDATE … WHERE status
//! = ?`, so two people pressing "ship" at once ship once.
