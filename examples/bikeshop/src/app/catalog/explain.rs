const FILTERS_FROM_QUERY: Feature = Feature {
    api: "Query<T>",
    why: "Every filter is a query-string value (`?brand=trek&size=M&price_max=900000`), \
          so a filtered page can be shared, bookmarked and reloaded. `Filters::apply` turns \
          them into conditions on `Product::query()`: `where_in_query` for brands and \
          sizes, `where_raw` with bound values for the `EXISTS` sub-queries (a variant \
          priced within the range, stock at a store, a part that fits), and each database's JSON \
          operator for the specifications. Nothing the visitor typed is written into the SQL.",
};

const PAGINATION: Feature = Feature {
    api: "Paginated",
    why: "`.paginate(db, filters.page, PER_PAGE)` (24 a page) runs the count and the page \
          in two queries and gives the template what Renox's `pagination` macro \
          (`renox/pagination.html`) needs; its `page_url(n)` keeps the filters in every page \
          link, so page 3 of a filtered list is still filtered. The links are boosted by \
          htmx and swap only the results (`hx-select`).",
};

const FRAGMENTS: Feature = Feature {
    api: "htmx fragments",
    why: "The filter form is a plain `GET` form. With htmx, a change sends it and the \
          handler answers only the `results` block (`view(…).fragment(\"results\")`), \
          which replaces `#results` while `hx-push-url` keeps the address in step. Without \
          JavaScript the same form reloads the page: one handler, both ways.",
};

const NO_N_PLUS_ONE: Feature = Feature {
    api: "renox::db::relations",
    why: "The cards' brands, categories, variants (for \"from …\" prices) and first photos \
          are loaded for the whole page at once with `belongs_to` and `has_many` \
          (`Card::load`): four queries for 24 products or 2, never one per product. \
          `tests/catalog.rs` counts them with `capture_queries` on the large seed.",
};

const ETAG: Feature = Feature {
    api: "Routes::etag",
    why: "`.etag()` hashes each answer and replies `304 Not Modified`, without the body, \
          when the browser or a crawler already has that version. The sitemap gets 304s \
          every time. HTML pages carry the layout's per-request CSP nonce in their script \
          tags, so today their hash changes on every request and they are always sent \
          whole (a Renox gap); the cart's count is fetched separately \
          (`cart.mini`) so it won't make pages differ once that is solved.",
};

const SEO: Feature = Feature {
    api: "seo()",
    why: "`seo(title=…, description=…, canonical=…)` writes the title, the description, \
          the canonical address (without the filters, so search engines index one page \
          per category) and the Open Graph and Twitter tags.",
};

const SOFT_DELETES: Feature = Feature {
    api: "#[model(soft_deletes)]",
    why: "Discontinued products are soft deleted: `Product::query()` leaves them out of \
          every list, search and facet, while past orders still point at them.",
};

const RANGE_SLIDER: Feature = Feature {
    api: "Bike shop blocks",
    why: "The kit has no price range slider, so the `range_slider` block \
          (`resources/views/blocks/range_slider.html`) sends two plain fields, `price_min` \
          and `price_max`, that the filters read like any other.",
