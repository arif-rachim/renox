//! Payments for anything the shop charges for: an order, a rental's
//! deposit or fees, a work order. One contract shared by the sales,
//! rentals and workshop areas.
//!
//! - Online: [`start`] records a pending `payments` row and gives the URL
//!   of the gateway's hosted page; the gateway's webhook marks it paid and
//!   the app emits [`PaymentSucceeded`] (or [`PaymentFailed`]).
//! - At the counter: [`record_counter`] records a cash or card payment
//!   that is paid at once, and emits [`PaymentSucceeded`] too.
//!
//! The areas that sell something listen to [`PaymentSucceeded`] for their
//! own [`Payable`] kind (an order becomes paid, a rental's deposit is
//! held, a work order is settled), so the payment code never needs to know
//! about them.
//!
//! Status: the coordinator wrote this contract before the sales story
//! (#234), which replaces the placeholder gateway in [`start`] with the
//! real one (hosted page + signed webhook through `renox::webhook`). Keep
//! the signatures; other areas already call them.
