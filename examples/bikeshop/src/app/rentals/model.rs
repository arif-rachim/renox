//! The rental fleet and rentals (Pagila's `inventory` and `rental`).
//!
//! Three store attributes meet here (#245):
//!
//! - a [`RentalBike`] has an **owner store** (whose books and asset it is:
//!   its rates, retiring or selling it are checked there) and a **location
//!   store** (where it stands now: renting it out is checked there);
//! - a [`Rental`] keeps the bike's owner store (for the books) and has an
//!   **operating store**, the one that served the customer (it earns a fee when the bike is another store's), and a
//!   return store when the bike came back elsewhere;
//! - a [`BikePlacement`] moves a bike's location to another store, on the
//!   owner store's approval, until it is called back.
//!
//! A rental's reservation code is a [`Ulid`]: short enough to read out at
//! the counter, sortable by time, and it doesn't reveal how many rentals
//! there are.
//!
//! Migration: `migrations/20260101000600_create_fleet_and_rentals_tables.*`.
