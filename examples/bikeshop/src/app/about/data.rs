//! `/about/data` (`about.data`): the bike shop's data model explained.
//!
//! What a reader learns here, from the code itself rather than a copy of
//! it: every table grouped by the area that owns its model, the relations
//! and how they are loaded, Pagila's tables and what they became, the three
//! store attributes, how money, secrets, statuses and deletions are stored,
//! the factories and the seeders, and the roles with their permissions
//! (read from `access::catalogue`). The row counts are live, so after
//! `demo:seed --size large` the page shows Pagila's volume.
