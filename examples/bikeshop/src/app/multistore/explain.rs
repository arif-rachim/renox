          the person was working in and the roles they held **there** (from `assignments`, never \
          a role-name check), so \"who did this, as what, where\" has an answer even for someone \

const SCOPES: Feature = Feature {

    why: "Lists start from `access::visible::<M>(permission)`: Renox's `scopes_with` turns the \
          person's roles into the stores they may see that in, and `Scopes::apply` filters on \
          the record's store columns (a row counts when **either** store is one of them). One \
          filter in SQL instead of a check per row, so paging and totals stay right; the \
          owner's global role sees everything, without any check on a role's name.",

const POSTING: Feature = Feature {
