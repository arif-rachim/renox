//! Stores and the people who work in them (Pagila's `store` and `staff`).
//!
//! **No role column on `staff`.** What someone may do comes from the
//! `Permissions` module's roles, given *in a store* (`assign_role_in` with
//! `Scope::of(&store)`, #244), with optional dates; the owner has a global
//! role. A row here only says who works for the company, their home store
//! and whether they are active. See `src/app/access` for the permission
//! catalogue and the policy helpers.
//!
//! Migration: `migrations/20260101000200_create_stores_and_staff_tables.*`.
