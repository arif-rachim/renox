//! The staff side (#239): the back office's home, the stores, the team and
//! its invitations, the role × permission matrix, the audit log, two-factor
//! login for staff, and the admin panel for the catalogue.
//!
//! Every page goes through `access::staff_routes` (a login, then
//! `staff.access` in the active store, `src/app/access`) and asks for its
//! own permission on top: `stores.manage`, `staff.manage`, `roles.manage`,
//! `audit.view`, `catalog.manage`. The admin panel (`renox-admin`) is
//! [`admin::panel`], registered in `src/lib.rs`.
//!
//! - [`stores`]: the stores' details, opening hours (a repeater) and fee rate;
//! - [`team`]: who works in the store, invitations, roles per store with
//!   dates, deactivation;
//! - [`roles`]: the role × permission matrix, edited live;
//! - [`audit`]: the audit log page and `audit::record`, which every area
//!   uses for its sensitive actions;
//! - [`two_factor`]: two-factor login required for staff;
//! - [`admin`] and [`catalog_tools`]: the panel and its two extra pages.
